Issue with orginal upload of Files 
- React pages folder when generated was created as its only git repo automatically. 
- I thought when git ignore was removed with was be pushed, only more recently 
- Only more recently checked and none of the react files were in the folder
- deleting .git also didn't fix it
- So created new folder "JavaScript_Upload2" with all react files
- Used version from git log 2023-03-31T23:55:00
